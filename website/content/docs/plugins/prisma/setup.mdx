```package-install
@pothos/plugin-prisma
```

## Setup

This plugin requires a little more setup than other plugins because it integrates with the prisma to
generate some types that help the plugin better understand your prisma schema. Previous versions of
this plugin used to infer all required types from the prisma client itself, but this resulted in a
poor dev experience because the complex types slowed down editors, and some more advanced use cases
could not be typed correctly.

### Add a the `pothos` generator to your prisma schema

```prisma
generator pothos {
  provider = "prisma-pothos-types"
}
```

Now the types Pothos uses will be generated whenever you re-generate your prisma client. Run the
following command to re-generate the client and create the new types:

```sh
npx prisma generate
```

additional options:

- `clientOutput`: Where the generated code will import the PrismaClient from. The default is the
  full path of wherever the client is generated. If you are checking in the generated file, using
  `@prisma/client` is a good option.
- `output`: Where to write the generated types

Example with more options:

```prisma
generator pothos {
  provider = "prisma-pothos-types"
  clientOutput = "@prisma/client"
  output = "./pothos-types.ts"
}
```

### Set up the builder

```typescript
import SchemaBuilder from '@pothos/core';
import { PrismaClient } from '@prisma/client';
import PrismaPlugin from '@pothos/plugin-prisma';
// This is the default location for the generator, but this can be
// customized as described above.
// Using a type only import will help avoid issues with undeclared
// exports in esm mode
import type PrismaTypes from '@pothos/plugin-prisma/generated';

const prisma = new PrismaClient({});

const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  PrismaTypes: PrismaTypes;
}>({
  plugins: [PrismaPlugin],
  prisma: {
    client: prisma,
    // defaults to false, uses /// comments from prisma schema as descriptions
    // for object types, relations and exposed fields.
    // descriptions can be omitted by setting description to false
    exposeDescriptions: boolean | { models: boolean, fields: boolean },
    // use where clause from prismaRelatedConnection for totalCount (defaults to true)
    filterConnectionTotalCount: true,
    // warn when not using a query parameter correctly
    onUnusedQuery: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' ? null : 'warn',
  },
});
```

It is strongly recommended NOT to put your prisma client into `Context`. This will result in slower
type-checking and a laggy developer experience in VSCode. See
[this issue](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/45405) for more details.

You can also load or create the prisma client dynamically for each request. This can be used to
periodically re-create clients or create read-only clients for certain types of users.

```typescript
import SchemaBuilder from '@pothos/core';
import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from '@prisma/client';
import PrismaPlugin from '@pothos/plugin-prisma';
import type PrismaTypes from '@pothos/plugin-prisma/generated';

const prisma = new PrismaClient({});

const readOnlyPrisma = new PrismaClient({
  datasources: {
    db: {
      url: process.env.READ_ONLY_REPLICA_URL,
    },
  },
});

const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Context: { user: { isAdmin: boolean } };
  PrismaTypes: PrismaTypes;
}>({
  plugins: [PrismaPlugin],
  prisma: {
    client: (ctx) => (ctx.user.isAdmin ? prisma : readOnlyPrisma),
    // Because the prisma client is loaded dynamically, we need to explicitly provide the some information about the prisma schema
    dmmf: Prisma.dmmf,
  },
});
```

## Edge run-times

When prisma is built for edge run-times like cloudflare workers, the prisma client no-longer exposes
the dmmf datamodel Pothos uses when building the schema. To work around this, you can have the
pothos generator generate the datamodel instead:

```prisma
generator pothos {
  provider          = "prisma-pothos-types"
  clientOutput      = "@prisma/client"
  output            = "./pothos-types.ts"
  generateDatamodel = true
  documentation     = false
}
```

When using the `generateDatamodel` option, the prisma client will add a `getDatamodel` function in
the generated output. When using this option, you should be using a `.ts` file rather than a `.d.ts`
file for the output.

When setting up the builder, you can now use the `getDatamodel` function:

```typescript
import SchemaBuilder from '@pothos/core';
import { PrismaClient, Prisma } from '@prisma/client';
import PrismaPlugin from '@pothos/plugin-prisma';
import type PrismaTypes from '@pothos/plugin-prisma/generated';
import { getDatamodel } from '@pothos/plugin-prisma/generated';

const prisma = new PrismaClient({});

const builder = new SchemaBuilder<{
  Context: { user: { isAdmin: boolean } };
  PrismaTypes: PrismaTypes;
}>({
  plugins: [PrismaPlugin],
  prisma: {
    client: prisma,
    dmmf: getDatamodel(),
  },
});
```
